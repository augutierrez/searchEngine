#### First-Time Setup

After creating your private project repository, you need to perform this one-time setup:

  1. Go to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` in your repository.

  2. Modify all of the templates to replace `FULL_NAME` with your full name.

  3. Modify all of the templates to replace `GITHUB_USER` with your **Github** username (not your USF or CS usernames).

  4. Delete the first-time setup text from all of the issue templates (including the hints below).

Here are some additional hints for using issues and pull requests:

  - You can [check the checkboxes](https://help.github.com/articles/about-task-lists/) and [apply labels](https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests) AFTER saving the issue.

  - Do not forget to change the issue title *and* command to include the project release number. If there are any mistakes, you will be required to fix those mistakes before the issue will be closed.

  - If this is your first release, use `N/A` to indicate there is not a previous release.

  - When in doubt, see the [template issues](https://github.com/usf-cs212-fall2019/template-project/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) for an example of how everything should look.

:warning: **This text should not appear on your issue. If so, you need to still modify the issue template.**
